         <h1>My Favorite Movies</h1>
         <p>The movies that are close to my heart are the ones 
            from India.
            <br> I have been away from India for nearly a quarter century. 
            I feel close to my country of origin when I watch the movies from 
            India.
            <br>
            I have listed ten movies of three different languages, Tamil,
            Hindi and English which are Indian.
